# Border Crossings Visualization

This Shiny app visualizes over 340,000 border crossings into the United States from 1996 to 2019!

Information about the data is here:

The visualization lets the user choose up to two border entry points and one method of entry (eg. pedestrians, trucks). The data is ploted as a time series using Plotly, and a map of the two points is plotted using Leaflet.

Happy visualizing!
